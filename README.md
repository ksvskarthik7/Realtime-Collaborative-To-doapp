- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on different screen sizes, thanks to its responsive CSS.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime used to execute server-side code.
- **Express:** A web framework for Node.js used to handle HTTP requests and serve static files.
- **Socket.IO:** A library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Front-end technologies used to create the user interface and handle client-side interactions.
